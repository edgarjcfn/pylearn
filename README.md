A game to learn python by typing into a browser-based interpreter

# this is a work in progress

Current version uses
 - [Skulpt](http://skulpt.org) - Browser-based python compiler and interpreter
 - [Wade](http://www.clockworkchilli.com/index.php/developers) - HTML5 game framework.

current version is a proof-of-concept. 
will evolve it to a proper game when I have time.
